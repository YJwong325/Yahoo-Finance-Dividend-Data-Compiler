# Yahoo Finance Dividend Data Compiler
A Python script to collect historical dividend data for S&amp;P/TSX 60 constituents on Yahoo Finance. May also work for stocks outside TSX 60.

# Technologies used
- YFinance library
- Pandas
- Gooey for GUI

### Choosing to use Gooey
I chose to use Gooey as a tool to make the script accessible to non-technical users quickly. With a Graphical User Interface, non-technical users can use the dividend data compiler without having to rewrite the code to suit their individual needs. 

Cosmetic improvements are introduced in future iterations of the application once the core functionality is complete and fully functional.
